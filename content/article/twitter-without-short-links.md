As [dev.to](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtwitter/fhlipionhojfohecgljcljbpblojlaef?hl=en-US), I created my own Chrome extension (sorry Firefox), I was tired of not seeing the complete URL of a tweet. I felt the right to know where I'm going to land. Also, a lot of information can be found in a URL ([URLs can be UI](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/url-as-ui/)), and my click can depend on them. Example :

![Without fasterLinks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polomarcus/faster-links/master/app/images/TweetWithoutFasterLink.png)

<center>*What's the complete name of the repo?*</center>
I've been using my extension, called **[fasterLinks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fasterlinks/ojggkiabpbjlckhpaphgdhhojgcpimah)** (worst name ever?), for **3 years now**, and even now I have trouble to use Twitter without it. So I wanted to share it with my favorite online community.! It replaces every short URLs (bitly, etc.) and display long, for twitter, URLs at their full length. ![With fasterLinks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polomarcus/faster-links/master/app/images/TweetWithFasterLink.png)<center>*fasterLinks!*</center>

Marketers love to add several [UTMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) to track tweets performance, as they are visual pollution, the extension removes them as well.

**fasterLinks** is free, [open source](https://github.com/polomarcus/faster-links), it does not contains any trackers, except the one used to count active users (28!!) on the Chrome store.

Fork it https://github.com/polomarcus/faster-links and/or try it https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fasterlinks/ojggkiabpbjlckhpaphgdhhojgcpimah
