# Forests - Analysis of narratives

Analysis led by QuotaClimat (see more on https://quotaclimat.org/en/) - made feasible thanks to the Media Observatory on Ecology technical databases (see more on https://observatoiremediaecologie.fr/).

Methodological disclaimer 1: all analysis are based on 2 minutes chunks containing the word "forest" from French audiovisual sources. No post-processing is done to ensure that countries or organization mentionned are actually related to the context of the forest itself. All the extraction is made with a Llama Instruct 70-B prompt engineered. The period analyzed is April 2023 - February 2025.

Methodological disclaimer 2: companies are probably mentionned mainly because of advertising rather than an actual link to companies related to forest industry
